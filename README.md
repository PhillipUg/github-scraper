## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://repl.it/@PhillipUg/tictactoe )

This is the third project of the Microverse Ruby Module

This is also the first project of the [Odin project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop)

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Installation

To play this game you need to:
* have ruby installed in your computer
* [download](https://github.com/adamclasic/tictactoe/archive/master.zip) or clone this repo:
  - Clone with SSH:
  ```
    git@github.com:adamclasic/tictactoe.git
  ```
  - Clone with HTTPS
  ```
    https://github.com/adamclasic/tictactoe.git
  ```
* and execute bin/main.rb file using your terminal

## Game Rules

  * This is a customized version of the original [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game. The basic rules remain unchanged, the tokens to play with have changed instead.

  * The game is played on a 3 by 3 grid
  ```
      X  |   X   |   X    
    ----------------------
      X  |   O   |   O    
    ----------------------
      X  |   X   |   X      
  ```

  * In this game, there are only two letters to play with 'X' and 'O'. Whichever player gets the first similar letters in an entire row, column or diagonal WINS!!!.
  * At the begining of the game, player 1 will choose either 'X' or 'O' and the other letter will be assigned to player 2 automatically.
  * Once the players both have letters to play with, they will use numbers 1 through 9 to select a position on the game board. for example:
    ```
      Player playing with 'X' enters position '2'.

          1   2   3  
        -------------
      1 |   | X |   | 3
        -------------
      4 |   |   |   | 6
        -------------
      7 |   |   |   | 9
        -------------
          7   8   9    

      Player playing with 'O' enter position '5'.

          1   2   3  
        -------------
      1 |   |   |   | 3
        -------------
      4 |   | O |   | 6
        -------------
      7 |   |   |   | 9
        -------------
          7   8   9   
    ```
    * The first player to get their letters in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins e.g.
    ```
  

          X | O | O    X | X | X     X | O | O     O | O | O
         -----------  -----------   -----------  -----------
          X | X | O    O | O | O     X | X | O     O | X | O
         -----------  -----------   -----------  -----------
          X | X | X    X | X | X     O | O | O     O | X | O
    ```
    * When all squares are full and no player has won, then game ends in as a Draw e.g.

      ```
           O   |  X   |  O     
        ----------------------
           O   |  X   |  X    
        ----------------------
           X   |  O   |  O     
      ```
